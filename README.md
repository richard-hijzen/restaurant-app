## Project Overview: Stage 1

For this project i turned a static design into a mobile ready design with the use of the grid layout.
I changed some tags to make it more clear what the structure of the page is in terms of accessebility.

At the end i also added a service worker. 

 
### What do I do from here?

1. Download the repository from github and go into the folder.

2. In this folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer. 

In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.
